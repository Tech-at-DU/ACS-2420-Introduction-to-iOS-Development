# Subscription Box


Are you familiar with subscription boxes? Maybe you've subscribed to one before.

There are subscription boxes for a lot of themes these days: wine, makeup, fishing, food, imported goods, pets and the list goes on.

During the term you'll build the prototype of an app that offers a subscription box service.

The project will cover most topics of the course and will serve as evidence and practice of your skills with UIKit and iOS development.

## Project Requirments

- Must use Xcode and Swift
- Must use a Tab bar controller and at least three tabs
- Must use a Table View
- Must use a navigation controller
- Must use a collection view

- Then I need a description of the subscription box?
- Subscription tab shows a list of possible descriptions in a collection view.
- Tapping a subscription shows a detail view for that subscription.
- Orders tab shows subscriptions you have ordered.
- Tapping an order should show a details page about the subscription and include a cancel order button.
- Subscription details should include an order button. Tapping the order button adds a subscription to your orders list.
- About tab shows a scroll view with information about the service.

**Stretch Goals**

- Use a Scrollview to scroll content. This could be used in the detial screen or about screen. 
- Use the UIPageViewController for the about page. This will allow you to swipe through views. 
- Add an on boarding screen using the UIPageViewController.
